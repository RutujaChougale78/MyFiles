    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Hey everyone, I'm a fresh <b>Fullstack Developer</b> eager to jump into the exciting world of web development! I've been building my skills in both <i>front-end</i> (think making things look great) and <i>back-end</i> (the engine that makes it work) through bootcamp, self-study, etc.. I'm a fast learner with a passion for clean code and problem-solving.<br/>
    I'm a team player who loves <u>collaborating and learning from experienced</u> developers.  I'm confident I can bring a fresh perspective and strong work ethic to your team. Excited to hear more!</p>
